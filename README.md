# Evaluating Fairness in Socially-Enhanced Recommendation System

This repository contains the code and documentation for evaluating the fairness of the GraphRec recommendation system. We aim to assess how the inclusion of social network features in recommendation algorithms might introduce biases, particularly with respect to user demographics and popularity.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for evaluation, including the Epinion dataset and any additional data required for analysis.
- `code/`: Contains the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for reproducing the GraphRec model and conducting bias evaluations.
- `results/`: Contains the results of bias evaluations, including tables, charts, and statistical analyses.
- `docs/`: Contains the project documentation, including the research proposal, experiment design, and analysis reports.
- `graphs/`: Contains visualizations generated during the analysis process.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphrec-fairness-evaluation.git
cd graphrec-fairness-evaluation
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts in the `code/` directory to reproduce the GraphRec model and conduct bias evaluations.

4. Explore the results in the `results/` directory and refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory for detailed analysis reports.
